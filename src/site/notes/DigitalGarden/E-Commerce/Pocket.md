[Pocket](https://pocket.com.bn) is a little product by TheeGMedia, claiming to be the [first cashless payment mobile app in Brunei](https://www.bizbrunei.com/2020/07/pocket-first-cashless-payment-mobile-app-in-brunei-linking-multiple-banks-cards/).

The method of use is that they expect the users/customers to store their card details on the Pocket app (a modern smartphone is required). Then when the customer wants to purchase something from a vendor, the vendor would have a QR code displayed at the counter to allow customers to scan and pay. The Pocket app is quite straightforward. Scan the QR code, enter the amount to pay, tap confirm, and the vendor gets notified of the payment.

However, when making payment on an online e-commerce store (like [healthybeauty365.bn](https://healthybeauty365.bn)), where the Pocket is one of the payment option, it only instructs the customer to pay via the mobile app again and without scanning any QR code.

The only upside is that there is no upfront or setup fees. Just pay transaction fees of some percentage.
