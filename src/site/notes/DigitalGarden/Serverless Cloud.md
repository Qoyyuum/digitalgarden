## Serverless.com Cloud

```ad-warning
15/11/2022 : This serverless seems experimental and may not be 100% working.
```

I've requested access to Serverless.com's Cloud service and so far, it seems to allow Javascript Frameworks only. I guess if I could pair up Quasar Framework and build a SSR + PWA combo, I might be able to use serverless cloud but I am not entirely sure how their data(base) works yet. At a glance, it looks like a JSON flatfile feature. I will continue experimenting it when I get the free time.
