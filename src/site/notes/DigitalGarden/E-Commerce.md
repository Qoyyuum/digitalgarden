## The Challenge(s)

One of the challenges that I can foresee with many young entrepreneurs, especially in Brunei, is getting started in Business. Aside from licensing and legal stuff, the act of selling a product is still a barrier to scale and expand to many customers, especially for a sporadic population density in Brunei.

Another challenge is to help these entrepreneurs who are also bootstrapped. They cannot always be affording to rent a unit, buy equipments and print out posters. So the ability to sell online should also not be financially burdening them with new unaffordable costs.

Lastly, a lot of these small-time homebased businesses in Brunei, tend to just advertise on just one or two platforms. Mainly Facebook and Instagram. We can see the appeal that it costs nothing to advertise on Facebook groups and posting enticing Instagram photos and videos and the ability to do business on the Metaverse platforms and products, including getting in contact over Whatsapp. (Side note: might experiment a [[DigitalGarden/Experiment/Digital Marketing Compaign on Metaverse\|Digital Marketing Campaign on Metaverse]])


## Existing Solutions that may/may not work

Current solutions like [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/WooCommerce\|Woo-Commerce]] or [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/MerchantSuite\|MerchantSuite]] expects to pay for server hosting and monthly maintenance fees. [[DigitalGarden/Shopify\|Shopify]] + [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Stripe Atlas\|Stripe Atlas]] would be the best solution for anyone to start selling online but the overwhelming starting cost from [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Stripe Atlas\|Stripe]] and the fear and uncertainty of doing taxes (as a Bruneian) is off-putting.

[[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Snipcart\|Snipcart]] could be the better solution as it is headless and cost a lot less to maintain versus Shopify. The downside is that there are little to no plugins to use to enhance the online shopping experience and would have to be redone from scratch by a technical developer.

## Solution (or to reach an achievable solution)

The alternative technology framework solution that I could think of is to use [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Coinbase Commerce\|Coinbase Commerce]] as it costs (nearly) nothing to set up. Just need an official domain name and then use Coinbase dashboard to create self-hosted checkout pages and send invoices. However, this is strictly for crypto payments.

Headless eCommerce set up is also an interesting approach. I just started looking at [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Odoo\|Odoo]] and [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/SpreeCommerce\|SpreeCommerce]]. However, I or the business would need to host the commerce themselves, which is not always ideal. If it were me, I could host it on their behalf, and that would be a [[DigitalGarden/E-Commerce/Headless ECommerce as a Service\|Headless eCommerce as a Service]] (HECaaS - also not to be confused with Brunei's [HECAS](https://www.hecas.moe.gov.bn/)).
